# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.28.0 - 2026-07-27

- Freeze the six-tool MCP, versioned HTTP/SSE, primary CLI, logical evidence,
  cache lifecycle, calculation-grade, four-token-class, JSON export, privacy,
  installation, and upgrade contracts.
- Qualify abrupt writer and content-worker death, storage failures, stale
  leases, promotion recovery, malformed requests, slow SSE clients, concurrent
  reads, large histories, public-version upgrades, and rollback with synthetic
  fixtures.
- Keep `exact`, `deterministic`, and `estimated` as the only calculation grades;
  report incomplete observations through explicit coverage rather than a
  fourth `partial` grade.
- Defer 1.0 until post-freeze dogfood while keeping optional context composition
  and the read-only overlay adapter outside the stable surface.

## 0.27.0 - 2026-07-27

- Add compact guided-exploration templates and filter grammar so models can
  compose bounded exact queries without a server-authored narrative layer.
- Add disabled-by-default, owner-only context-composition evidence with
  explicit privacy confirmation, bounded incremental reads, exact observed
  bytes, optional estimator coverage, and deletion that leaves accounting
  untouched.
- Freeze a read-only future-overlay adapter boundary over existing status,
  evidence, and generation-event routes without adding an overlay bundle,
  capture, write, refresh, credential, raw-content, or external-transmission
  authority.
- Harden Evidence Console stream-gap recovery by closing the stale EventSource,
  resnapshotting, and reopening without its retained event cursor.

## 0.26.0 - 2026-07-27

- Replace the beta analysis and compatibility product with a lean local data
  kernel for exact incremental facts, bounded model-driven queries, evidence
  timelines, live reconnect, and allowance efficiency.
- Ship exactly six MCP tools, ten operational CLI commands, seven kernel API
  routes, and a focused Evidence Console with no implicit refresh or narrative
  analysis job.
- Preserve the 0.25 cache beside the new kernel, build only on explicit
  refresh, promote atomically, and retain rollback metadata without reading or
  rewriting the legacy database.
- Remove retired telemetry, OTel, compression, diagnostics, recommendations,
  content indexing, compatibility profiles, and legacy dashboard assets from
  the installed package.

- Archive the completed MCP-first roadmap and establish the Product Kernel
  Reset program around exact incremental facts, model-owned inference, live
  evidence, a six-tool MCP surface, side-by-side cache cutover, and removal of
  the beta analysis and compatibility shell.
- Add an early K1A code-quarantine gate, four-way per-path disposition, and a
  non-publishable integration branch so retired beta code leaves the active
  agent worktree before kernel implementation.

## 0.25.1 - 2026-07-25

- Remove the experimental local telemetry parser, cursor, staging,
  reconciliation, refresh phase, diagnostics, and support-bundle surface;
  schema 38 drops the retired tables without rebuilding canonical usage rows.
- Reuse the active compatible refresh when stale analysis needs current data,
  including across moving-tail source revisions, instead of spawning
  conflicting refresh jobs.
- Build job status and detailed progress from one durable row snapshot so a
  poll cannot report an outer running state with nested failed progress.
- Route large-history `execution="auto"` analysis through a durable async job,
  and preserve completed refresh and analysis results across MCP restarts.
- Keep no-change and append-safe refresh work proportional to the moving tail:
  allowance observations, reset-aware materialization, thread links, and
  interval revisions no longer rebuild total-history derived state. Schema 38
  replaces low-selectivity interval revision indexes.

## 0.25.0 - 2026-07-25

- Prioritize central-product reliability before compatibility removal, moving
  the existing removal and stabilization roadmap stages to 0.26 and 0.27.
- Give generated plugin bundles a deterministic skills/assets digest and
  invalidate only a stale same-version Codex cache owned by this plugin.
- Keep MCP and Evidence Console startup read-only while equivalent refreshes
  join one durable cross-process job in an operational sidecar database.
- Parse append-active JSONL only through fixed complete-line byte boundaries,
  expose progress/generations/tails/timing, and resume stale analysis after its
  durable refresh dependency.
- Remove the legacy static dashboard generator, assets, screenshots, CLI
  aliases, MCP tool, and configured static serving. The live Evidence Console,
  CSV/JSON exports, exact deep links, and focused query plans remain.
- Keep Home call, token, and cache totals current when recommendation analysis
  lags the incremental index, and remove persisted findings/evidence from the
  Home load path.

## 0.24.0 - 2026-07-24

- Introduce an explicit application composition root and dependency protocols,
  remove Python dependency cycles, and enforce the architecture with Tach.
- Enable SQLite foreign-key enforcement, make schema migrations fail
  atomically, harden rebuild recovery, and advance the additive schema to
  version 37.
- Seek directly to indexed context byte offsets while preserving a bounded
  sequential fallback for older rows and unusually large selected turns.
- Persist reusable analysis jobs, results, progress, errors, and lease recovery
  so interrupted work no longer depends on process-local memory.
- Preserve focused Home, Limits, Calls, Threads, and thread-call endpoint
  performance instead of replacing them with slower generic queries.
- Make release quality, changed-line coverage, architecture, workflow pinning,
  product complexity, package size, and build-once artifact promotion directly
  blocking.
- Convert five legacy dashboard workbenches to localized, notice-only routes
  that start no historical queries or jobs. CLI, HTTP, CSV export, and
  full-profile MCP compatibility remain available through 0.24.x and are due
  for removal in 0.25.0.
- Preserve the refresh deduplication index and make compression-status polling
  query-only to avoid avoidable SQLite write contention.

## 0.23.0 - 2026-07-23

- Focus the Evidence Console on Home, unified Calls/Threads Explore, Limits,
  utility Settings, and contextual call/thread/finding/allowance Evidence.
- Restore the Home usage pulse, live loading progress, guided MCP/plugin setup,
  copyable investigation prompts, and a first-visit Calls/Threads switch cue.
- Make timeframe, history, model, effort, confidence, source, pricing, and
  credit filters use focused endpoints with exact counts and scoped totals.
- Render expanded thread calls with the same legible call rows, pricing, and
  credit semantics as Calls.
- Keep `service serve --refresh` immediately usable by refreshing in the
  background, and batch canonical deduplication lookups during ingestion.
- Credit
  [`@nrlcode`](https://github.com/nrlcode) and
  [PR #291](https://github.com/douglasmonsky/codex-usage-tracker/pull/291)
  for independently identifying the dropped-index deduplication bottleneck
  and contributing reproducible large-refresh benchmarks and regression-test
  design. The release ships the batched lookup solution to the same root cause.
- Keep five legacy workbenches directly routable with explicit transition
  guidance while removing them from primary navigation.
- Add eight bounded HTTP API v2 routes backed by the same application services
  and contracts as the seven-tool MCP core.
- Remove the experimental Usage Constellation, Three.js dependencies, tests,
  and packaged assets.
- Introduce the exact 11-command primary CLI with `config`, `service`, and
  `admin` namespaces while preserving historical aliases through 0.24.x.

## 0.22.0 - 2026-07-22

- Establish the MCP-first product pivot program, including the `0.22.0` through
  `0.26.0` release sequence, bounded compatibility and deprecation ledgers, an
  execution ledger, and a freeze on unplanned dashboard and public-surface
  growth.
- Add seven canonical MCP tools for status, refresh, analysis, query, evidence,
  allowance, and job polling, all returning the shared versioned envelope.
- Default repository and installed-plugin MCP launchers to the ordered
  seven-tool `core` profile while retaining non-developer 0.21/PR290 names in
  `full` and every 0.21/PR290 name in `developer`.
- Add deterministic routing coverage for ten representative usage questions
  and equivalence coverage for existing totals, pricing, allowance, and
  subagent calculations.
- Reposition the existing browser surface as the supporting Evidence Console;
  this release does not change dashboard navigation.

## 0.21.0 - 2026-07-17

- Keep the macOS dashboard available at a stable, localhost-only URL with a
  login LaunchAgent, explicit port-collision handling, health checks, and
  install, status, and uninstall commands.
- Preserve responsive inline thread expansion while bounding initial work and
  polishing progressive call loading, retry behavior, and row presentation.
- Preserve full-width Windows filesystem identifiers so distinct sources do
  not collapse during aggregate usage ingestion.
- Ingest aggregate `response.completed` telemetry from local
  `codex-completions*.jsonl` exporter files and conservatively reconcile exact
  Fast/Standard service-tier evidence to canonical calls without retaining raw
  response bodies or arbitrary OTLP attributes.
- Show exact service tier separately from the existing Fast proxy in Calls,
  details, and CSV exports; older or unmatched history remains Unknown.
- Apply documented model-family Fast multipliers to confirmed Codex credit
  estimates with source URL/date/confidence and local overrides while leaving
  standard-credit allowance calibration unchanged.
- Cache Standard, Batch, Flex, and Priority API pricing together, select the
  observed tier per call, and expose Standard/Priority cost scenarios plus an
  explicit local billing basis without applying ChatGPT Fast multipliers to API
  USD estimates.
- Preserve exact response tiers in dashboard labels and CSV contracts, clear
  OTel staging on confirmed database reset, and make incremental source cursors
  descriptor-safe across concurrent file rotation. Verify a bounded content
  anchor before resuming so same-inode rewrites cannot silently skip telemetry.

## 0.20.0 - 2026-07-16

- Reinvent the Threads tab around inline row expansion, progressively loading and virtualizing every call in the selected thread while preserving explicit investigator actions, deep links, responsive layouts, retry recovery, and aggregate-first privacy boundaries.
- Complete the Simplified Chinese dashboard experience across React views, visualization metadata, tables, accessibility text, CLI help, and dashboard lifecycle messages while preserving user-provided data verbatim.
- Improve the Overview token-flow chart at constrained desktop widths with a taller single-column layout, larger Sankey node gaps, and label-safe padding; keep virtualized evidence-table actions on one row.
- Apply official long-context input, cached-input, and output price multipliers to concrete calls above 272K input tokens when the selected OpenAI service tier publishes long-context rates, while keeping aggregate summaries from being incorrectly thresholded.

## 0.19.0 - 2026-07-15

- Redesign Limits Intelligence around weekly credits-per-percentage capacity
  history, a compact current-status row, automatic revision analysis, and zero,
  one, or multiple family-wise-controlled capacity changes. Rejected split
  statistics stay hidden, five-hour usage remains observed context, and the v2
  API/MCP contracts expose capacity points, regimes, provenance, and copied-row
  diagnostics by default.

## 0.18.0 - 2026-07-15

- Exclude exact historical calls copied by cloned Codex tasks from default dashboard, CLI, MCP, report, allowance, compression, recommendation, and export totals while retaining every physical source row for local provenance.
- Add aggregate deduplication diagnostics across the CLI, MCP server, localhost API, and dashboard status strip, including physical, canonical, and excluded row/token counts with bounded provenance metadata.
- Preserve new post-clone calls as normal usage, promote a surviving copy when an original source disappears, and migrate existing local indexes without losing usage history.
- Restore large-history dashboard performance with canonical query indexes and explicit SQLite join/scan plans; the 100,000-row route budget now passes for summaries, recommendations, diagnostics, threads, and thread-call paging.

## 0.17.2 - 2026-07-09

- Add GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna API pricing and Codex credit-rate support, including the official `gpt-5.6` alias and compatibility with OpenAI's new cache-write pricing column.

## 0.17.1 - 2026-07-09

- Stabilize async dogfood cache fingerprints so repeated unchanged MCP dogfood runs can reuse cached reports even when SQLite file metadata changes during read/report activity.

## 0.17.0 - 2026-07-08

- Add agentic MCP investigation tools for hypothesis-driven usage diagnostics, compact evidence briefs, and actionable recommendation reports.

- Add async dogfood progress polling and warm result caching so longer usage investigations can report progress and rerun faster.
- Speed up content indexing with incremental append metadata, parallel source parsing, and batched FTS rebuilds.
- Add dashboard refresh progress bars, no-cap paged loading, loaded-call metrics, token breakdowns, persisted loading preferences, and restored usage-drain chart data.

## 0.16.2 - 2026-07-08

- Restore Usage Drain, Investigator Workbench, Reports, and related dashboard charts by deriving shared usage-drain series from loaded aggregate rows again.
- Keep sparse line charts expanded to their panel width so low-point datasets do not collapse into the left edge.

## 0.16.1 - 2026-07-08

- Add async refresh progress polling and dashboard progress bars for long all-row loads.
- Speed up local content index refreshes with batched writes and parallel source extraction.
- Load uncapped dashboard rows in finite pages so no-cap mode stays responsive on large histories.
- Show loaded-call counts and call-level token breakdowns on Overview metric cards.
- Restore session row/history loading preferences after browser refresh without storing large row payloads.

## 0.16.0 - 2026-07-07

- Add allowance intelligence foundation with normalized allowance history, evidence-graded change diagnostics, local evidence exports, and API/MCP report surfaces for weekly-vs-5-hour usage analysis.
- Add local content-indexed MCP/API exploration surfaces, including content search, thread trace, pattern scans, investigation walks, and strict local evidence exports.
- Add roadmap for default local content indexing, SQLite FTS5 search, parser drift handling, and future diagnostics for repeated file rediscovery, shell churn, and large low-output calls.
- Fix schema initialization so already-applied migrations are not rerun during read/report calls on migrated local databases.

## 0.15.1 - 2026-07-05

- Fix the PyPI wheel package resources by tracking the React dashboard `index.html` entrypoint used by `serve-dashboard` and installed-package smoke tests.

- Harden React dashboard context evidence and diagnostics smoke tests against current row-selection and duplicate-heading behavior.
- Recenter the README around talking with the plugin/skill about local aggregate usage, with example conversation docs for token-waste and remediation workflows.

## 0.14.1 - 2026-07-04

- Harden React dashboard responsive chrome, including topbar control wrapping, table containment, sticky table affordances, mobile nav polish, and refreshed synthetic dashboard screenshots.

## 0.14.0 - 2026-07-04

- Make `serve-dashboard --open` prefer the React dashboard route while keeping legacy `/dashboard.html` available as a localhost fallback, and expose both URLs in `serve-dashboard --json`.
- Restore major legacy dashboard parity in the React dashboard, including overview recent-call loading controls, sticky thread/header table affordances, row-to-investigator actions, diagnostics fact-call pagination, report and call sorting state, and legacy URL/filter normalization.
- Add local-only transition safeguards: the prominent unofficial-project banner, aggregate-only privacy boundaries, rebuilt dashboard assets, and release-gate documentation for the React bundle.
- Prioritize weekly usage windows in Overview and Settings so weekly remaining usage is surfaced ahead of short 5-hour windows.

- Add guided usage-summary diagnostics across CLI, API, and dashboard to explain the largest aggregate drivers behind usage.

## 0.13.0 - 2026-06-30

- Add first-run onboarding docs covering install, setup, live-dashboard launch, empty-dashboard troubleshooting, plugin discovery, and safe issue diagnostics.
- Improve `doctor --json` first-run environment reporting so support requests can distinguish missing logs, empty history, and plugin/runtime path issues faster.
- Add safe support-bundle issue-report fields and issue-template guidance so users can attach diagnostics without leaking prompts, tool outputs, commands, patches, or raw paths in strict mode.
- Strengthen installed-wheel lifecycle smoke coverage across setup, doctor, dashboard generation, strict support bundles, and plugin resources.
- Harden strict support-bundle redaction for nested diagnostic paths, Python executable paths, and resolved `/private/var`-style platform path aliases.

## 0.12.1 - 2026-06-29

- Ship the package-domain boundary refactor behind compatibility facades so existing CLI, imports, dashboard routes, JSON payloads, and MCP entrypoints keep working while the source tree is organized by responsibility.
- Add Tach domain configuration files, refreshed Agent Maintainer baselines, and package-boundary documentation for the new module layout.
- Restore `python -m codex_usage_tracker.cli` after the CLI package split and add regression coverage for both module entrypoints.
- Split allowance pricing helpers into smaller modules while preserving the public allowance facade.

- Validate the refactor against a frozen local JSONL rebuild comparison before release.

## 0.11.4 - 2026-06-27

- Fix `codex-usage-tracker setup` on large local histories by batching stale diagnostic-fact deletes so SQLite does not exceed bound-variable limits during usage index refresh.
- Add synthetic regression coverage for large diagnostic fact refreshes under a low SQLite variable ceiling. Thanks to `@gevikhn` for the Windows setup failure report.

## 0.11.3 - 2026-06-23

- Fix Windows `serve-dashboard` asset loading by forcing JavaScript, CSS, JSON, and SVG MIME types in the localhost server instead of trusting OS registry MIME mappings.

## 0.11.2 - 2026-06-23

- Fix served dashboard shell hydration so `serve-dashboard --no-refresh` reliably populates the calls table from `/api/usage` when the initial HTML contains zero rows but indexed rows are available.
- Harden the synthetic source-log benchmark smoke test so shared-runner timing noise does not leave a stale red release check.
- Improve benchmark smoke test failures so future threshold failures report the parsed JSON payload and threshold details instead of only a generic subprocess error.

## 0.11.1 - 2026-06-23

- Move projected weekly credits to the top of the Diagnostics tab and add the 95% CI range to the projection table.
- Add per-section `Reload` controls for stale or missing diagnostic snapshot cards so one failed or missing section can be recomputed without a full diagnostics refresh.

## 0.11.0 - 2026-06-22

- Add usage-drain diagnostic reports for token accounting, allowance breakpoints, predictive model highlights, weekly visible usage, weekly projected credits, and cumulative thread cost curves.

- Add usage-drain modeling documentation and a synthetic README screenshot focused on the new diagnostics charts.
- Harden diagnostic table alignment, parser-warning visibility, file-modification rendering, and Python 3.14 type-check coverage.

## 0.10.1 - 2026-06-21

- Add lightweight action timing metadata to context evidence so call investigations can show elapsed time for parsed tool and command actions without persisting raw command text or outputs.
- Add synthetic README diagnostics coverage for the Git Interactions panel and package the screenshot with installed plugin docs.

## 0.10.0 - 2026-06-21

- Add Git/GitHub CLI diagnostic snapshots with safe operation labels, coarse categories, mutability buckets, and terminal token-count coverage.
- Add file-modification diagnostic snapshots for structured patch events, modified-path aggregates, extension counts, and largest modification events without storing patch text or raw paths.
- Add derived call timing fields for call start, duration, previous-call timestamp, and previous-call gap across dashboard rows, details, CSV/export actions, live API sorting, and thread aggregates.
- Surface `Duration`, `Prev gap`, `Longest duration`, and `Longest gap` in the dashboard with localized labels and focused regression coverage.
- Reconcile all diagnostics panels into one release so `overview`, `tool-output`, `commands`, `git-interactions`, `file-reads`, `file-modifications`, `read-productivity`, and `concentration` can refresh together from the live dashboard.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-06-21

- Add persisted aggregate diagnostic snapshots with explicit on-demand refresh metadata and schema-versioned CLI/API contracts.
- Add dashboard Diagnostics panels for overview, tool output, commands, file reads, read productivity, and concentration.
- Add tool-output and command reports with terminal token-count buckets, missing-count coverage, command roots, and expandable command children.

- Add concentration reports for top source/session, project/cwd, and day shares without leaking raw source-log paths.
- Keep Diagnostics refresh isolated from normal live dashboard refresh so regular usage updates do not recompute or blink diagnostic panels.
- Add Playwright diagnostics smoke coverage and release documentation for the snapshot pipeline, privacy boundary, and on-demand refresh behavior.

## 0.8.1 - 2026-06-20

- Make Diagnostics fact tables easier to scan by widening and pinning the Fact column while horizontally scrolling.
- Add API-backed sortable headers to top-level Diagnostics fact tables, including cached input, output, cache ratio, largest call, latest call time, occurrence, call-count, and fact-name sorts.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-06-20

- Add an aggregate Diagnostics dashboard for inspecting diagnostic facts, associated calls, token totals, and on-demand evidence without persisting raw transcript text.
- Add diagnostic fact extraction, reporting APIs, dashboard drilldowns, sortable associated-call tables, and load-more controls for larger diagnostic result sets.

- Harden dashboard startup so visiting Diagnostics before other views load no longer prevents Calls, Threads, or Overview from hydrating.
- Make Live refresh use the cached/indexed append path and fetch only newly visible leading rows instead of running the full manual refresh reset cycle.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-06-18

- Parse latest observed Codex usage snapshots from local rate-limit and token-count log events without persisting raw transcript text.
- Store observed 5h and weekly usage snapshot fields in aggregate rows and expose a latest-observed usage summary for dashboard and API consumers.
- Add a dashboard card for latest observed 5h and weekly usage with wording that distinguishes local observations from authoritative account limits.
- Default the dashboard table experience to time-sorted Calls, replace the visible Signals column with Reasoning Output, and keep the Signals field out of the table for now.
- Ignore known non-token parser events so refreshes stay focused on usage-bearing records.

## 0.6.1 - 2026-06-13

- Polish the README landing screenshots with matched dashboard/investigator previews and an additional lower investigator evidence view.
- Restore the companion plugin prompt preview near the companion skill section and package companion screenshots with installed docs assets.
- Keep dashboard toolbar links styled like buttons in the call investigator.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-06-13

- Remove low-value call/thread anchor diagnostics from the experimental call investigator to avoid an extra source-log scan per context load.
- Persist call-origin metadata as categorical aggregate fields during indexing so normal dashboard payloads do not reopen source JSONL logs to infer user-vs-Codex initiation.
- Persist archived-session scope, conservative thread keys, and per-thread previous/next call links as aggregate helper fields for faster dashboard filtering and investigator navigation.
- Add opt-in localhost API timing diagnostics for `/api/usage` and `/api/context` without exposing raw transcript content.
- Reduce explicit context loading to a quick default mode that omits tool output and serialized buckets, with full serialized JSONL bucket analysis still available on demand.
- Add source-log-aware synthetic benchmark coverage that verifies normal dashboard payload assembly does not open generated source JSONL files.
- Add SQL-backed live dashboard API slices for status, calls, one call, threads, thread calls, summary, and recommendations while preserving the compatibility `/api/usage` endpoint.
- Materialize active and all-history thread summaries in SQLite so live thread APIs can read pre-aggregated totals.
- Add source-file refresh cursors so live refresh skips unchanged logs, seeks to appended JSONL bytes when safe, and safely replaces aggregate rows for changed or truncated source logs.
- Hydrate direct call-investigator links from the aggregate `/api/call` endpoint when the selected record is outside the currently loaded table slice or filter state.
- Replace placeholder non-English dashboard locale catalogs with translated UI catalogs and add regression coverage for core visible labels.

- Harden the production PyPI workflow so manual publishing must run from `main` or a tag ref before artifacts are downloaded and uploaded.
- Skip TestPyPI/PyPI uploads when the exact distribution version already exists on the target index, allowing a GitHub Release to be reconciled after a workflow-dispatch publish.
- Strengthen `scripts/check_release.py` so it validates the publish-ref preflight inside both the TestPyPI and PyPI jobs.
- Check off completed 1.0 readiness items with evidence for migration coverage, localhost dashboard smoke testing, and the protected GitHub `pypi` environment.
- Pin the marketplace MCP runtime launcher to the exact `codex-usage-tracking==0.4.1` package.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-06-09

- Add official Python 3.14 support across CI, package classifiers, README/install docs, and installed-package Docker smoke coverage.

- Pin the marketplace MCP runtime launcher to the exact `codex-usage-tracking==0.4.0` package.

## 0.3.2 - 2026-06-08

- Make `open-dashboard` and `serve-dashboard` refresh active-session logs by default, with `--no-refresh` as the explicit cached-index mode.
- Add a token-protected dashboard action for enabling context loading without restarting a localhost server that started with context loading off.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-06-08

- Fix packaged Codex Usage Tracker skills so dashboard-open requests start the live localhost dashboard instead of a static snapshot.
- Mirror live-dashboard skill guidance between source-tree skills and packaged plugin-data copies so release and wheel checks stay green.
- Use the valid explicit context API flag form, `serve-dashboard --refresh --context-api explicit --open`, for live dashboard launches.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-06-08

0.3.0 is a stabilization and public-preview release for the dashboard, CLI, MCP tools, local privacy model, packaged Codex plugin, and companion usage skills. The PyPI/TestPyPI distribution name is now `codex-usage-tracking`; the GitHub repository remains `douglasmonsky/codex-usage-tracker`, the Python import package remains `codex_usage_tracker`, and the installed CLI command remains `codex-usage-tracker`.
