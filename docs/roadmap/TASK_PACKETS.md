# Clean-Cutover Task Accounting

Master ledger for the [roadmap](AGENT_FIRST_CLEAN_CUTOVER.md); linked
[task files](tasks/) own scope and acceptance. The
[machine DAG](REMAINING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md) controls delegation; CK-09–16
parents are accounting umbrellas.

## Overall

- Completed packets: **14 / 22**
- In progress: **None**
- Not started: **8**
- Critical-path completion: **14 / 21**
- Optional packets: **CK-15**
- Completed corrective child tasks: **14 — CK-08R0, CK-08R1A, CK-08R1B, CK-08R1C, CK-08R1, CK-08R2, CK-08R3A, CK-08R3, CK-QG1A0, CK-QG1A, CK-QG1, CK-07R1A, CK-07R1A0, CK-07R1**
- Remaining delegable child tasks: **36**
- Ready child tasks: **1 — CK-08R4**
- Conditional-ready child tasks: **0**
- Blocked child tasks: **35 — CK-08RG/CK-09 and downstream remain blocked; CK-08R4 is the sole Ready packet**
- Orchestration mode: **convergence — one coordinator, one existing task per active packet, at most one shared-authority task**
- Continuation policy: **reuse the active packet task for ordinary corrections; create a task only for a newly Ready distinct packet or a genuinely new authority decision**
- Handoff policy: **tasks proactively message the parent; no polling or wait-only tasks**
- Identity policy: **exact-main plus repository-relative paths; receivers recompute digests before acting**

## Remaining delegated child tasks

Readiness is controlled by
[the machine DAG](REMAINING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md). R1C and R1B are accepted after
R1A; R1 is complete on merge with a schema-valid 80/80 two-lane
requalification artifact. CK-07R1's post-terminal deterministic-evidence
roadmap completion makes CK-08R4 the sole Ready successor. CK-QG1 is accepted
and exact-main verified; other corrective locks are unchanged.

### CK-07R1 hosted CI authority supplement

The [clean-committed CI authority v2](../decisions/evidence/ck07r1a0/lifecycle-terminal-failure-clean-commit-authority-v2.json)
binds the exact repository-local hosted `.venv` seam for PR #448 without
reopening the consumed run, authorizing a retry, or changing receipt-based
acceptance and downstream holds.

### CK-07R1 post-terminal roadmap completion

The [post-terminal completion authority](../decisions/evidence/ck07r1a0/lifecycle-post-terminal-completion-authority-v1.json)
binds exact PR #447/#450/#448 lineage, hosted CI, merged exact-main tree, the
seven immutable implementation/evidence paths, deterministic planner and
small/large publication-path validation, full/package evidence, and the clean
implementation review. It completes only the CK-07R1 roadmap dependency while
permanently preserving `failed_after_launch`, token consumed/non-refundable,
`runtime_acceptance=not_claimed`, absent planner-valid receipt/output, and
unavailable `post_single_run`/`final_accepted`. It authorizes no command or
artifact mutation. CK-08R4 is the sole Ready successor; CK-08RG and CK-09
remain blocked.

Historical lineage remains explicit: the prelaunch-recovery authority
preserves v1 `prelaunch_failed`; the terminal-failure correction authority
binds the v2 `failed_after_launch` root cause and no-rerun correction; and the
clean-committed transition plus
`lifecycle-terminal-failure-clean-commit-authority-v2` bind PR #448's clean
publication representations. None of those historical transitions is
rewritten or reactivated.

## Critical path

`CK-00 → CK-01 → CK-02 → CK-03 → CK-04 → CK-05 → CK-06 → CK-07 → CK-07B
→ CK-07C → CK-07D → CK-07E → CK-07A → CK-08 → corrective Waves 1–4
→ CK-09 → CK-10 → CK-11 → CK-12 → CK-13 → CK-14 → CK-16`

CK-15 remains outside the critical path unless the maintainer explicitly
promotes it into the release.
