# Remaining Clean-Cutover Execution Plan

**Status:** Central execution authority for all remaining delegated work

This file controls readiness, ownership, and parallelism. The phase roadmap is
[AGENT_FIRST_CLEAN_CUTOVER.md](AGENT_FIRST_CLEAN_CUTOVER.md); completion is in
[TASK_PACKETS.md](TASK_PACKETS.md). Reconcile any conflict before delegation.

## Current decision

CK-09 remains blocked until CK-08R independently proves semantics, physical
paging, measurements, and scale. CK-08R0 freezes the exact contracts and
requalification frontier in `docs/decisions/evidence/ck08r0/corrective-gates-v1.json`.
Preserve CK-03–CK-08 history and supersede only its four named claims.
Retained CK-08R3 pre-scale evidence at commit
`a28e9cdbff8e48d334712a449fdcee111c725673` proved the EvidenceService outer
query physically unbounded independent of scale profile. CK-08R3A corrected
that production path in PR #417, passed hosted Python 3.10/3.14 and Console,
and was squash-merged and exact-main identity verified at
`38537f6cee42ad4ba2fb6e45354e410053c7a7cd`. The same premerge tree passed
focused, dual-SQLite, full, package, safety, and review gates. A duplicate
postmerge full runtime rerun did not complete because the host exhausted disk
space and SQLite could not create temporary files; no product assertion
failed, and this environment-only limitation does not override the exact-tree
and hosted acceptance evidence. CK-08R3 then qualified the separate
synthetic 100,000-call and 1,316,864-call profiles with `first_failure=null`,
all 196 selector/view/direction outcomes per profile, typed seven-part truth,
late-event, truncation, cursor, and query-only contracts. PR #425 passed hosted
Python 3.10/3.14 and Console, squash-merged at
`0fad272b3205614fb254398c9c9dc0a56d5ba7cd`, and was exact-main verified.
CK-08R3 and CK-08R1 are complete. CK-07R1 is complete through its separate
post-terminal deterministic-evidence roadmap transition, so CK-08R4 is Ready.
Retained CK-08R1 work reached
80/80 parity by copying unsupported Q-REV-03/Q-WF-02 semantics; R1A now freezes
their meaning and closure. R1C is accepted at exact main
`fb0c57886097a6b985d2f321b2de858cbdfc0a97`; the exact
[R1B join authority](../decisions/evidence/ck08r1b/answer-semantics-join-authority.json)
binds the shared query/evidence/grading seams accepted through PR #430;
CK-08R1B then passed the exact 23-path cohort,
80/80 production-versus-independent replay, full local/package gates, one
bounded review, and hosted Python 3.10/3.14 plus Console checks in PR #430;
it squash-merged and was exact-main verified at
`9e9332b3ae2be78cedb581ff8f76149ad76f4440`. CK-08R1 requalified all 80
synthetic variants through separate production and independent closures with
exact rows, grades, order, evidence, provenance, null semantics, grading
isolation, and sentinel mutations. Its schema-valid
[`answer-truth-requalification.v2`](../decisions/evidence/ck08r1/answer-truth-requalification-v2.json)
passed hosted CI in PR #439, squash-merged, and was exact-main verified at
`0832b85411e68feb9cf1a7300ab14e4cc97d391a`. The R1B exact reviewer correction
binds production
publication hierarchy ownership, independent start/terminal window membership,
duplicate stable-ID rejection, production-compiler replay, and the Q-REV-03
direct-fact/internal-formula decision. Its exact selected-cohort acceptance
correction additionally requires all authoritative late relationships before
one hierarchy computation and explicit non-null required tool timestamps.
The final writer-closure correction extends that atomic cohort to 23 paths:
writer-owned prior-state loading supplies every connected existing ancestor and
descendant, preparation emits every changed descendant after reparenting, and
unaffected session rows remain exact. The final multi-publication correction
retains those 23 paths and binds the remaining closure seam:
`SessionObserved` native parents seed their exact semantic parent component,
and persisted/incoming late-parent relations compare event/source coordinates
so stale replay cannot reverse a newer reparent. Exact replay is idempotent;
conflicting equal-order parent or basis declarations fail closed. The selected
cohort now also seeds an existing directly reparented session so its complete
persisted descendants are recomputed, requires parent/basis/occurrence
provenance equality for equal-coordinate idempotency, and resolves
current-batch relations by the six-part authority order before logical
identity with one emitted winner. PR #430 passed hosted CI, squash-merged, and
was exact-main verified at `9e9332b3ae2be78cedb581ff8f76149ad76f4440`.
R1B and R1 are complete. CK-08R4 is the sole Ready successor after CK-07R1's
post-terminal roadmap dependency completion.
CK-QG1A removed R2's two page-executor C/B/B violations
without changing behavior or the frozen maintainability baseline and is
accepted at exact main `30983d4b5005e7e2a507757c76a3c05ab56281e6`.
The linked [CK-QG1 exact maintainability baseline transition authority](../decisions/evidence/ckqg1/maintainability-baseline-transition-authority.json)
permitted only the exact accepted-main writer provenance finding transition.
PR #392 then passed exact normalized baseline enforcement, full validation,
review, and hosted Console/Python 3.10/3.14 before squash merge and fresh
exact-main verification at `68050b9313ccc5be8e1fcd0ccd5b95cb4173f3ff`.
CK-QG1 is complete; its v2 [writer transition authority](../decisions/evidence/ckqg1/maintainability-baseline-transition-authority.json)
binds current main `dd771073` writer `13da341f…` to reviewed PR #430 writer
`d163e6c5…` with the unchanged `fda777e2…` baseline and identical normalized
findings. CK-08R1B is accepted at `9e9332b3`; CK-08R1's serialized
production-versus-independent answer-truth requalification is accepted through
PR #439 and exact-main `0832b854`. CK-08R4 is Ready; CK-08RG remains blocked
on CK-08R4.
CK-07R1A is accepted, merged, and exact-main verified at
`4d8074952f679877f2b4fbb3e89c51015e96a197`; CK-07R1A0 was accepted at
`519b503aa3b23019033b6481687c08b23fc6c31e`; its linked
path authority remains preserved read-only. The finite source/runtime,
run-invocation authority, and argv-correction authority are merged through
`479cbdbfdd39604fc90eb94777ea0270474adde2`. PR #394 is a stale failed witness: head
`98a9b5b82951d136644a5fe5f8a70d320131ba08` failed the hosted Python 3.14
`ordinary.2000_call_tail` gate and is superseded read-only. It must not be
updated, rerun, or merged. The planner-valid lifecycle receipt is an
acceptance output of the existing CK-07R1 worker. The coordinator recorded the
preserved incident disposition and the worker derived the exact candidate
cohort from exact main `6c08ecd9`: preparation `66c015de…`, benchmark
`f108dbb4…`, and lifecycle test `4c514889…`. That cohort remains
permitted-not-accepted and cannot enter `worker_prequalification` until this
authority transition merges and exact-main verifies.
The versioned [shared successor overlay](../decisions/evidence/ck07r1a0/shared-successor-overlay-authority-v1.json)
preserves the accepted CK-08R1B v1, CK-08R1 evidence, and CK-QG1 authority
bytes and reconciles only their consumers with this atomic CK-07 transition.
Predecessor-only, exact complete successor, and every mixed, partial, extra, or
other-digest state remain explicit and fail closed.
The old frozen-command attempt is preserved exactly as a terminal
`pre_child_argv_guard_failure` (exit 2 after `0.075241709` seconds, no child or
runtime evidence), and its old benchmark/test identities cannot be reused.
Only `(sys.argv[0], *sys.argv[1:]) == LAUNCH_COMMAND[1:]` is authoritative.
The argv-correction authority is accepted and merged at
`479cbdbfdd39604fc90eb94777ea0270474adde2`. During its local proof, an
instrumentation mistake invoked the corrected candidate from the retained V5
witness and stopped at the child-handshake boundary. It produced only the
preserved `prelaunch_failed` launch-token ledger, with
`token_consumed=false`, no successful child/PID/receipt/runtime evidence, and
no retry. The witness remains read-only. The incident does not authorize a
launch or replacement worker.
The first sample, 720-second wrapper timeout, all five underlying budgets,
one-run ceiling, and every fail-closed rule remain binding. The versioned
[consuming-boundary authority](../decisions/evidence/ck07r1a0/lifecycle-consuming-boundary-authority-v1.json)
is the only transition from the already-proven exact
`worker_prequalification` state to `launch_authorized_once`. It activates only
after its single hosted-green authority PR is squash-merged and the exact
merged main is locally verified. Until then no worker may launch. After that
handoff only existing worker `019fbfe2-8fe4-7de2-9264-d58572366727` may use
the frozen cwd and exact command to perform exactly one synthetic
qualification launch with the complete `66c015de…` / `f108dbb4…` /
`4c514889…` cohort. That ownership is enforced normatively by the coordinator
resuming the exact existing Codex task and recomputing repository evidence; it
is not a runtime-authenticated identity and the launcher must not claim a
cryptographic per-task credential. The hosted Console gate retains Chromium
dependency/browser coverage, pins the canonical HTTPS Ubuntu archive, and
fails closed under bounded install/job timeouts rather than accepting a
stalled or skipped Console result. Historical accepted R3A
`6689d61f…`, revoked `d192c858…`, mixed cohorts, and every other digest are
predecessor-only or fail-closed and cannot enter `worker_prequalification`.
The worker may enter `worker_prequalification` only with the exact selected
cohort, `post_single_run` only with a complete planner-valid receipt and bound
dynamic evidence identity, and `final_accepted` only after worker merge and
exact-main verification. The still-unspent one-run token remains
`unspent_unavailable` until every immediate prelaunch gate passes. It may then
be consumed only by the first successfully observed exact child launch and
handshake; it is non-refundable and authorizes no retry, restart, or
replacement. All four frozen artifact paths must be absent before launch, and
any prelaunch failure remains non-consuming. The frozen launcher imports the
shared-successor verifier before ledger creation or fork; on
`worker_prequalification`, that verifier requires the complete consuming
authority, frozen cwd, capacity at or above 10 GiB, and candidate
`HEAD == refs/remotes/origin/main == live ls-remote origin/main`. Hosted-green
squash merge remains the repository merge control. The frozen launch lane
must then fetch and fast-forward only from prequalification base `67bb1a…` to
the exact merged main, preserving and recomputing the exact three dirty cohort
bytes before preflight. Reset, rebase, stash, a non-fast-forward transition,
or any cohort-byte change fails closed; historical V9/V10 witnesses remain
immutable. Earlier wording that says to
resume, refresh, or rerun PR #394 is
historical provenance and does not authorize action. This source-digest
authority supersedes earlier CK-07R1 wording that says to resume, refresh, or
rerun PR #394; those retained references are historical provenance and do not
authorize action.

The exact-main v1 consuming invocation is now a second preserved prelaunch
incident: after all immediate gates passed, macOS represented the forked
Python process with the app-bundle executable rather than the lexical venv
symlink target, so the exact child snapshot was not recognized. The command
terminated after `6.518352` seconds at `child_start_handshake`, exit 1, with
the sole durable v1 ledger SHA-256
`5c2b42eca6a3e54cf4163226bc55f3c75aa35112c4ed0342c11f4e39cb9922be`.
That ledger is terminal `prelaunch_failed`, `token_consumed=false`, and
`unspent_unavailable`; no verified child, release, runtime output, stdout,
stderr, or receipt exists. It is immutable and its command/path set cannot be
reused. The additive
[prelaunch-recovery authority](../decisions/evidence/ck07r1a0/lifecycle-prelaunch-recovery-authority-v1.json)
may admit one corrected v2 invocation by the same worker only after it binds
the exact corrected cohort, parent/child process-snapshot semantics, preserved
ledger bytes, non-colliding v2 paths, authority merge, exact-main, and every
immediate gate. Because no successful child launch occurred, this is the first
remaining token-funded successful-launch opportunity, not a retry, restart,
replacement, or refund of a launched process.
The non-colliding files are the exact
`output/ck07r1/lifecycle-requalification-v2` output, launch-token ledger,
stdout, and stderr paths.
Current CK-08R1 requalification consumers preserve every accepted CK-08
authority and evidence byte while selecting this recovery bridge only when
its exact versioned authority exists; predecessor-only and exact complete
successor states remain explicit, and mixed or partial states fail closed.

The v2 recovery opportunity has now been consumed and is terminal. Exact child
PID `20482` passed the handshake and consumed the non-refundable token at
`2026-08-19T19:44:55Z`; the child exited 70 before producing output or a
receipt. The immutable v2 ledger
`570e27824ee04a51aa4012adb461bd4aebb00b61541f2477fd9e1665854325a2`
records `failed_after_launch`, `token_consumed=true`, and no retry, restart, or
replacement. Its stderr
`4cf4b10fd04f20a190e4ac41898d25b9295b3dc9d7addead8a81edd27b3aca2f`
shows that the reachable planner correctly selected `APPEND_SAFE_LARGE` for
1,369 selected records while the benchmark incorrectly required
`APPEND_SAFE_SMALL`; the accepted small-tail ceiling remains 32 records.
The versioned [terminal-failure correction authority](../decisions/evidence/ck07r1a0/lifecycle-terminal-failure-correction-authority-v1.json)
permits the same worker to correct only the benchmark and its owned lifecycle
test, with exact planner-selected small/large paths and deterministic
synthetic non-consuming evidence. It does not reopen either command, refund
the token, authorize any launch, fabricate a receipt, or make
`post_single_run` or `final_accepted` reachable. It left CK-07R1 blocked after
corrective implementation prequalification pending the separate roadmap
decision now recorded below.
The linked
[clean-committed transition authority](../decisions/evidence/ck07r1a0/lifecycle-terminal-failure-clean-commit-authority-v1.json)
keeps the v1 authority immutable while binding PR #448 base `652f2166…`,
source head `927aa06f…`, and the exact seven-path cohort. The same bytes may be
represented only as an all-or-none dirty prepublication delta over the exact
authority-main tree or as a clean committed PR/integrated delta with exact
base, scope, and hashes. Neither representation reopens the consumed run or
changes the existing blocked state.

The additive [clean-committed CI authority v2](../decisions/evidence/ck07r1a0/lifecycle-terminal-failure-clean-commit-authority-v2.json)
preserves the v1 bridge bytes and binds the clean hosted matrix's
repository-local `.venv` creation before verification. It recognizes only the
exact 18-path follow-up authority delta and exact 18-plus-seven integrated
PR #448 state. This deterministic environment correction does not authorize a
qualification command, another child, token action, retry, receipt,
implementation acceptance, or downstream readiness.

PR #448 then passed hosted Console and Python 3.10/3.14, squash-merged its
exact seven-path correction/evidence cohort, and was fresh exact-main verified
at `1d0466b1b2992b48c5272dc4598606eeaea4dae2`. The additive
[post-terminal completion authority](../decisions/evidence/ck07r1a0/lifecycle-post-terminal-completion-authority-v1.json)
is the explicit roadmap decision reserved by the terminal-failure authority.
It accepts exact merged deterministic planner reproduction, small/large
writer-path validation, promotion/recovery/rollback/readability proof,
independent fold equivalence, full/package checks, one clean implementation
review, hosted CI, and exact-main identity only for CK-07R1 dependency
completion. The v2 run remains `failed_after_launch`; the token remains
consumed and non-refundable; planner-valid receipt and output remain absent;
`runtime_acceptance=not_claimed`; and `post_single_run` and `final_accepted`
remain unavailable. No launch, retry, restart, replacement, refund, artifact
mutation, receipt fabrication, failed-run reclassification, or production
semantic change is authorized. CK-08R4 is the sole Ready packet and must
independently measure current merged publication behavior without claiming
the missing CK-07R1 runtime acceptance. CK-08RG and CK-09 remain blocked.

The exact V11 launcher contract constructs and validates the fully
overlay/cohort-bound receipt and non-null stdout/stderr/output evidence before
any first durable `completed` finalization. Evidence
read/hash/parse/validation/finalization failure is terminal
`failed_after_launch`, never false `completed`. Temporary parent SIGINT/SIGTERM
handlers route every wait interruption/error through bounded TERM/KILL/reap
before terminal persistence and remain installed through evidence, receipt,
and terminal ledger finalization; originals restore only after the terminal
state attempt. Every terminal fallback persistence call masks SIGINT/SIGTERM
with the existing ignore guard and restores the prior temporary handlers
afterward; the outer final restoration of original handlers remains last. The
fork child ignores SIGINT/SIGTERM while
waiting for parent release and maps every pre-release failure to
`os._exit(71)`; parent cleanup rejects nonpositive PIDs. Unique same-directory
`mkstemp` ledger updates close and unlink on failed or interrupted
write/fsync/replace/post-replace paths and persist durable consumed/no-retry
`failed_after_launch` evidence without temporary residue. It also requires the
lexical repository-worktree `.venv/bin/python` and matching lexical venv `sys.prefix`; base interpreters,
symlink/resolved equivalence, wrong-worktree venvs, and prefix mismatch fail
closed.

## Delegation law

- Delegate only **Ready** child packets; CK-09–CK-16 parents are umbrellas.
- Use one durable coordinator, one existing task per active packet, and at most
  one shared-authority task. Sol at medium reasoning owns readiness,
  integration, collision handling, and gates; bounded deterministic workers
  normally use the less costly Luna profile at max reasoning. `architect` is
  read-only.
- Start at exact dependency-complete `origin/main`, one worktree/branch/PR.
- After verified merge, create only uncreated newly Ready distinct packets.
  Reuse the existing packet task for implementation defects, tests,
  environment setup, validation corrections, review findings, and exact-main
  reapplication. A new authority task requires a genuinely new policy or
  contract decision.
- Every task proactively messages its parent on completion, blocking, or a
  fail-closed stop. The handoff triggers continuation; do not create polling or
  wait-only tasks.
- Exact-main plus repository-relative artifact paths are authoritative.
  Receivers recompute digests and exact commands from committed manifests
  instead of trusting multi-hop prompt transcription.
- Before a one-shot or irreversible operation, prove the exact entry point and
  process boundary with a real non-consuming integration preflight. Stubbed or
  in-process tests alone are insufficient.
- Use bounded subagents inside the active task for focused read-only research,
  tests, or one independent review. Durable tasks represent independent
  ownership, not every intermediate correction.
- Classify blockers as implementation, authority, environment, or external.
  Once crash integrity is restored, leave recovery mode and return to this
  convergence topology.
- One integrator owns shared authority/schema/registry/publication/package/
  release/final evidence; parallel writes are disjoint.
- Producers name artifact, consumer seam, independent truth, and executable
  comparison. Disproved premises stop dependents and retain reproduction,
  digest, and measurements; never weaken gates or hide failed prototypes.
- Synthetic fixtures only; no real Codex bodies, secrets, or private/local
  databases. Task names use `<role> <short-scope>`.

## Shared-file integration locks

Only one integrator may own a lock at a time:

| Lock | Files or interfaces |
| --- | --- |
| Authority | `AGENTS.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, roadmap, this plan, ledger, qualification plan, parent packets |
| Query physical | request/result contracts, query registry/compiler bindings, cursor version |
| Evidence physical | `EvidenceService` fixed page SQL, scope-to-branch selection, bound parameters, focused physical tests |
| Publication physical | analytical DDL, projection registry, writer/preparation integration ports |
| Installed surface | application envelope, MCP catalog, plugin manifest, `.mcp.json`, entry points |
| Qualification | candidate hashes, fixture identity, scorecard/evidence schemas, final aggregates |
| Cutover/release | package membership, CI, version fields, release workflow and artifact manifest |

## Parallel wave summary

The machine DAG below controls readiness and dependencies; each child packet controls its owner and scope. Only these fan-outs are allowed:

- CK-08R0 -> CK-08R2/CK-08R3A; CK-08R1A -> CK-08R1B/R1C
  -> CK-08R1; CK-08R2 -> CK-QG1A0 -> CK-QG1A -> CK-QG1;
  CK-08R3A -> CK-08R3;
  CK-07R1A -> CK-07R1A0 -> CK-07R1;
  join at CK-08R4/CK-08RG.
- CK-09-01 -> CK-09-02/03/04; join at CK-09-05.
- CK-10-01 -> CK-10-02 and CK-10-04; CK-10-03 follows 10-02; join at 10-05.
- CK-11-01 -> CK-11-02/03; join at CK-11-04.
- CK-12-01 -> CK-12-02/03/04/05; join at CK-12-06.
- CK-14-01 -> CK-14-02/03; join at CK-14-04. CK-15 is optional and CK-16 remains gated.

All other edges are serialized. `Ready` authorizes creation; `Conditional Ready` requires its machine gate; `Blocked` forbids creation and implementation.

## Machine-readable delegation DAG

Tests bind this manifest to the ledger, child files, statuses, known
dependencies, and acyclic order. Conditional policy gates such as optional
CK-15 selection and maintainer publication approval remain stricter prose
conditions in the table and child files; they are not unconditional DAG edges.

If CK-09-01 admits no projection in a family, that family task closes as
`Not needed` with evidence and no production diff. If CK-15-01 defers native
presentation, CK-15-02 closes the same way and does not block CK-16.

## Phase completion gates

- CK-09 becomes ready only through CK-08RG. No fixed projection count is
  authoritative before CK-08R4.
- CK-10 starts only after CK-09-06 is merged, hosted CI is green, and exact
  `main` is verified.
- CK-11 starts only from the coherent CK-10 wheel/plugin/skill candidate.
- CK-12 lanes consume one immutable candidate and fixture digest. A semantic
  fix invalidates the affected lanes and creates a bounded follow-up; no lane
  edits the candidate while other lanes measure it.
- CK-13 starts only after CK-12 accepts every hard gate.
- CK-14 deletion starts only after CK-13 proves reinstall/rollback and the
  maintainer approves runtime retirement.
- CK-15 is optional. It blocks release only when CK-15-01 explicitly selects
  it into the release candidate.
- CK-16-04 is an approval-gated public action. No task may publish from a local
  rebuild or mutate already published bytes.

## Handoff minimum

Record exact SHA, PR/CI, ownership, artifact/digest, consumer/truth, validation/
first noise, reviewer/risks, orchestrator ID, and Ready/created task/host IDs
with frontier. Receivers verify authority first.
