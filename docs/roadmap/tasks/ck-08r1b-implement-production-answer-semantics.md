# CK-08R1B — Implement production answer semantics
**Status:** Completed on merge — PR #430 hosted-green, squash-merged, and exact-main verified at `9e9332b3ae2be78cedb581ff8f76149ad76f4440`
**Recommended owner:** `worker production-semantics`; Sol-class
**Accounting:** [TASK_PACKETS.md](../TASK_PACKETS.md); [REMAINING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](../REMAINING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md); [AGENT_FIRST_CLEAN_CUTOVER.md](../AGENT_FIRST_CLEAN_CUTOVER.md)
**Goal:** Implement R1A Q-REV-03/Q-WF-02 semantics.
**Dependencies:** R1A accepted/merged/exact-main.
**Owned files/interfaces:** The exact 23-path successor cohort in the [join authority](../../decisions/evidence/ck08r1b/answer-semantics-join-authority.json), superseding the preserved PR #430 head after reviewer findings. It adds production publication hierarchy ownership, production-compiler 80-case replay, Q-WF-02 straddling lifecycle correction, independent duplicate-ID rejection, and the explicit Q-REV-03 direct-fact/internal-formula binding decision. The selected-cohort acceptance correction requires every authoritative late relationship to apply before one complete acyclic hierarchy computation, rejects late cycles and ambiguous or missing parents, proves reverse-order chains through production publication and compiler replay, and rejects explicit null required start or terminal timestamps in production and independent truth. The final correction explicitly owns `publication/writer.py`: writer prior-state loading supplies the complete connected ancestor/descendant session component, preparation emits every changed descendant after reparenting, and unaffected rows remain exact. Query compiler admission, synthetic materialization, R1C's exact seams, deterministic fixture generation, database/reference parity, and Candidate A plan requalification are allowed only as bound there; public API, EvidenceService, cursor, projection, and unrelated evaluator changes remain forbidden.
**Multi-publication closure:** Writer seeding normalizes a `SessionObserved` native parent to the exact semantic session identity and loads its complete existing component. Persisted and incoming late-parent relations compare exact event/source coordinates: newer authority wins, exact replay is idempotent, and conflicting equal-order parent or basis declarations fail closed. Reparented descendants recompute; unaffected components remain exact.
**Selected-cohort closure:** Direct reparent of an existing `SessionObserved`
seeds that session and its complete persisted descendants. Equal six-part
coordinates are idempotent only for exact parent, relationship basis, and
occurrence provenance; other evidence fails closed. Current-batch relations
use the six-part authority order before logical identity and emit one winner
across input permutations.
**Produces:** Exact comparison/boundaries/nulls and closure.
**Independent truth source:** R1A plus R1C's preserved recursive closure and facts-only evaluator, requalified at the exact stale Q-WF-02 seam; no grading source or copied expected rows in production.
**Consumer seam:** `compile_plan_operands` emits final-R1 materializations.
**Parallelism:** Resume only existing worker `019fc419-0dab-73e3-a6cc-ce574f18c89f`; no replacement implementation or authority task.
**Non-goals:** Query/public/projection/R3/R4/RG/09.
**Invariants:** Production publication owns complete acyclic session hierarchy; no test fallback may manufacture it. Explicit complete tool start/terminal coordinates are selected independently at window boundaries. Canonical-call `measurement_mask` and four token classes remain exact. Q-REV-03 answer objects are direct facts and its named formulas are bound internal diagnostics. No placeholders; malformed/null/mismatch/duplicate fails closed; CK-08R2 and 19 fail-closed residual plans unchanged; synthetic; sdist <=2,000,000.
**Required tests/checks:** Recompute authority identities; R1A vectors; formula/operand/query/database/closure; deterministic fixture regeneration with unchanged source JSONL; full 80-case independent-versus-production rows/grades/order/provenance/null replay; all authority negative mutations; `just vp`; `just v/vc`; reviewer/CI/merge/exact-main.
**Acceptance:** Facts alone drive output; no grading source. Exact
authority-selected 23-path cohort; focused 284; authority/negative 160;
synthetic production-versus-independent replay 80/80; `just vp`, `just v`, and
`just vc` green with 1,465 passed and 1 skipped; one bounded reviewer clean;
hosted Console and Python 3.10/3.14 green.
**Failure/rollback:** Any cohort, closure, hierarchy, coordinate, measurement, row, grade, provenance, or regeneration mismatch fails closed; keep R1 blocked and request new authority only for a genuinely new policy decision.
**Handoff:** PR #430 merge `9e9332b3`; R1A digest/R1C closure/23-path cohort,
full 80-case production-compiler comparison, gates, and risks accepted. R1 is
Ready after this coordinator accounting merge.
**Cleanup/docs:** Completed by this accounting reconciliation; retained
implementation and exact-main worktrees remain preserved.
**Suggested commit:** `fix: derive supported answer semantics`
