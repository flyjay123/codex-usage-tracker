# Agent-kernel database-v1 physical schema contract

**Status:** CK-04 production authority with CK-07C fact, CK-07D rate-card, and conditional CK-08R3A evidence-order amendments
**Contract:** `codex-usage-tracker.agent-kernel.schema-contract.v1`
**Database identity:** `codex-usage-tracker.agent-kernel.v1`
**Operational-sidecar identity:** `codex-usage-tracker.agent-kernel.operations.v1`
**Canonical SHA-256:** `1a2dcffe778633457bbeb60dd3a41c233a78c15af2a3393bf9cacc1d9e645bb5`

This document closes the physical-schema decisions required before CK-05,
CK-06, and CK-07. It is the implementation contract for those packets.
Candidate A remains the measured design reference; production code must not
import, copy, or execute anything under `experiments/physical-architecture/`.
The DDL below is a clean specification of the selected mechanisms, including
the production relationships and recovery state that the experiment did not
implement durably.

CK-07C amends the analytical inventory only with the body-free
`context_components` relation and its timeline index. That addition is the
minimum physical fact surface required for positive structural-context
coverage; it is not a content store, query projection, or CK-04 bake-off
rerun. CK-07C also completes the already-selected allowance-cycle,
allowance-interval, and late-parent writer paths without adding further
tables.

CK-07D makes `rate_card_revisions.effective_at_us` mandatory and adds the
immutable `predecessor_rate_card_id` lineage edge. The predecessor contract
remains a 42-table/44-index inventory. The conditional CK-08R3A cohort adds
exactly 13 evidence-order indexes, producing the selected 42-table/57-index
digest below. `active_rate_card` remains the publication-selected head;
publication validation must reproduce its complete predecessor chain before
promotion.

## CK-08R3A schema/publication transition authority

The canonical database-v1 contract above remains the predecessor contract
until the CK-08R3A implementation is accepted. The selected EvidenceService
candidate is permitted to requalify only with the exact transition below. It
adds 13 evidence-order indexes, changes the resulting digest to
`998343ba4b52bb39decfcb436f8a862d41884fc6f6a6b4e88f7e8f8e42446295`, and
does not authorize any other schema, publication, selector, cursor, or query
semantic change. For session-scoped lifecycle pages, the current successor
also persists non-null `lifecycle_transitions.session_id` and uses the
session-leading `evidence_lifecycle_by_session_order` index; the earlier
entity-leading/`7a2e1c8a…` candidate is revoked because it emits a temporary
sort under unrelated foreign lifecycle history. The transition is a contract
fixture, not an active DDL replacement on this authority branch.

Turn source rank is zero-based and nonnegative: rank 0 is valid, and every
rank greater than zero is preserved exactly. The manifestation rank,
observation rank, persisted `turns.start_source_rank`, and EvidenceService
rank must be equal. A current-schema builder may use the primary occurrence's
`record_ordinal` only to fill an absent source order before persisting the
required non-null `start_source_order`; predecessor artifacts are rejected
without migration or compatibility mutation.

The [CK-08R3A bounded-session merge-sort portability authority](../decisions/evidence/ck08r3a/bounded-session-merge-sort-portability-authority.json)
narrows only the planner wording for the supported physical contract. On the
portable SQLite 3.45.1 boundary, a deep `timeline` or `allowance_interval`
session branch may emit one `USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY` because its session
merge input is proven at most one row through the sessions primary-key,
occurrence primary-key, and unique manifestation lookup chain. The lifecycle
branch must still use `evidence_lifecycle_by_session_order(session_id=?)`;
first pages and every other deep shape remain marker-free. This is not a
generic EXPLAIN relaxation, a host-version special case, an additional
derived-order key, or a production/DDL/schema change.
The linked [portable-plan branch-ownership authority](../decisions/evidence/ck08r3a/portable-plan-branch-ownership-authority.json)
requires the full `id`/`parent`/`detail` topology to identify the unique
leftmost session-event merge input and to reject markers under calls, tools,
lifecycle, or ambiguous sibling chains.

The selected block is composed after the canonical `analytical-ddl` payload
and before the unchanged operational payload only when the linked
schema/publication authority is accepted. Its exact 57-index inventory,
publication manifest bindings, frozen synthetic fixture digests, and the
tiny-accounting covering-index expectation are recorded in
`docs/decisions/evidence/ck08r3a/schema-publication-requalification-authority.json`.

## Contract boundaries

The analytical artifact and operational sidecar are separate SQLite databases.
The analytical artifact is accounting truth. The sidecar owns work
coordination, leases, pointer intent, progress, and recovery bookkeeping, but
is never joined to answer an analytical query.

This clean-cutover contract has no migration path or compatibility views.
An artifact carrying an earlier database-v1 schema digest fails validation
closed and is rebuilt from its admitted sources under the current exact
digest.

All tables are `STRICT, WITHOUT ROWID`. Every declared column is ordered and
binding. A column without a `DEFAULT` clause has no default; its writer must
supply a value or explicitly supply `NULL` when nullable. JSON-valued `TEXT`
columns contain UTF-8 RFC 8259 JSON serialized with sorted object keys, compact
separators, and no insignificant whitespace. Decimal-valued `TEXT` columns use
the logical contract's canonical finite decimal representation and are
validated by the repository before insertion.

Logical IDs and public selectors remain opaque text. Integer physical keys are
private implementation details. Identity collision handling is physical:
`identity_registry` retains the canonical CBOR bytes and digest, and a writer
must compare the bytes for an existing logical ID before accepting another
occurrence. A digest match with different canonical bytes fails the
publication.

Producer, source-root, source-file, and occurrence coordinates are provenance,
not semantic usage identity. Canonical identity CBOR for sessions, turns, model
calls, tool invocations, activities, compactions, state changes, and allowance
observations MUST NOT include `producer_id`, `source_id`, `manifestation_id`,
`manifestation_key`, `technical_path_key`, filesystem identity, content
revision, source rank, record ordinal, or byte offsets. Copies of one logical
record may therefore add occurrence coordinates without adding another
accounting entity.

## Time, intervals, and total order

Every `*_at_us`, `*_from_us`, `*_through_us`, `*_start_us`, and `*_end_us`
column is a signed 64-bit count of UTC microseconds since
`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Every `*_duration_us` column is an integer number of
microseconds. Missing upstream time is `NULL`; ingestion or filesystem time
must not replace it. Invalid or negative observed duration is stored as `NULL`
with a source diagnostic.

Calendar boundaries require an explicit IANA timezone and are converted once
to UTC integers. All persisted and query intervals are half-open
`[start_us, end_us)`, except the already-frozen synthetic named history inputs
whose closed end is converted at the adapter boundary.

The authoritative evidence order is:

```text
(
  event_at_us IS NULL ASC,
  event_at_us ASC,
  source_rank ASC,
  source_order ASC,
  event_kind_order ASC,
  logical_id ASC,
  transition_rank ASC
)
```

Observed instants therefore precede missing instants. `source_rank` is assigned
deterministically from the ordered source inventory; `source_order` is the
adapter's nonnegative complete-record order within that source;
`event_kind_order` is the frozen adapter registry rank; and
`transition_rank` orders multiple transitions of the same logical entity.
Arrival order and SQLite row order are never ordering inputs.

Each `producer_id` defines an independent producer clock domain. UTC
microseconds remain the storage unit, but timestamps from different producer
clock domains are not assumed synchronized. `source_rank` is assigned from the
deterministically ordered producer/source/file inventory, so the total order
above remains a stable pagination order across producers. That cross-producer
order is a presentation order only: it MUST NOT be described as chronology,
causality, or happens-before. Per-source-root clock quality and any finite
uncertainty bound are published in `publication_source_coverage`.
The inventory rank key is ascending canonical UTF-8 bytes of
`(producer_id, adapter_id, source_kind, adapter_native_source_key,
adapter_native_file_key, manifestation_id)`; mutable labels, paths, revisions,
and arrival order never participate.

## Analytical artifact DDL

The creation order below is part of the contract. It separates semantic
identity, physical occurrences, current lifecycle folds, and append-only
lifecycle transitions. A canonical entity may have many rows in
`source_occurrences` but contributes at most one row at its accounting grain.

<!-- analytical-ddl:end -->

`selector_anchors` is a physical optimization for the ten listed kinds, not
the complete logical selector registry. The four additional logical kinds
(`model_profile`, `rate_card`, `source_manifestation`, and `window`) resolve
through their existing authoritative owners under
`selector-provenance-v1.json`; windows are request-owned non-persisted values.
This owner dispatch requires no database-v1 DDL amendment.

### Required analytical metadata and validation

`metadata` contains one row per key for at least these keys:

```text
database_identity=codex-usage-tracker.agent-kernel.v1
schema_contract_id=codex-usage-tracker.agent-kernel.schema-contract.v1
schema_contract_sha256=<digest at top of this document>
schema_version=1
raw_content_stored=false
time_unit=utc_microseconds
interval_semantics=[start,end)
```

Each write connection enables `foreign_keys=ON` before beginning work. Published
analytical and operational databases use these exact connection settings:

```text
page_size=4096
journal_mode=WAL
synchronous=NORMAL
foreign_keys=ON
busy_timeout=5000
cache_size=-20000
mmap_size=0
temp_store=MEMORY
wal_autocheckpoint=1000
```

`page_size` is applied before the first table is created. Read-only connections
open by SQLite URI `mode=ro`, set `query_only=ON`, `foreign_keys=ON`, and
`busy_timeout=5000`, and do not issue a write-capable journal-mode change.
Unpublished isolated builders use `page_size=4096`, `journal_mode=OFF`,
`synchronous=OFF`, `foreign_keys=ON`, `busy_timeout=5000`,
`cache_size=-20000`, `mmap_size=0`, and `temp_store=MEMORY` only while
owner-only. Before promotion they restore the production settings, checkpoint
with `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`, close, validate, file-sync, and directory-sync.

Prepublication validation includes the contract digest, required metadata,
`quick_check`, `foreign_key_check`, publication-head/committed-state agreement,
identity collision comparison, configured-producer uniqueness, source-root and
stable-file-lineage ownership, occurrence ownership, lifecycle-fold
reconciliation, cross-table model-call uniqueness, tail-state reconciliation,
per-source-root coverage totals and clock-bound validity, and publication-delta
reconciliation. Release qualification also runs `integrity_check`.

## Source cursor, occurrence, and lifecycle ownership

`source_producers.producer_id` is an opaque stable logical ID.
`configured_producer_key` is the required, explicitly configured stable key
from which the producer identity is canonicalized. Neither value is inferred
from a hostname, absolute path, hardware identifier, account, network address,
or mutable display label. `display_label` is optional presentation metadata
and never identity input. This table is a provenance seam only; it does not
admit collectors, networking, authentication, synchronization, services, UI,
or Candidate A remote behavior.

`sources.source_id` is the stable source-root identity (the
`source_root_id`). Its canonical identity tuple is exactly
`(adapter_id, producer_id, source_kind, adapter_native_source_key)`, matching
the declared uniqueness constraint. `source_manifestations.manifestation_id`
is a stable source-file lineage identity whose tuple is exactly
`(source_id, adapter_native_file_key)`. `technical_path_key` is only the
adapter's canonical nonempty root-relative technical provenance: it uses `/`
separators, has no `.` or `..` segment, and never contains an absolute host
path. A replacement at the same technical path receives a new
`adapter_native_file_key` and `manifestation_id`; content revisions of the same
file lineage retain the existing manifestation identity.

`publication_source_coverage` owns exactly one coverage row for every
`(publication_id, source_id)` source root in the publication inventory.
Selected, deferred, malformed, missing, and uncertain counts and bytes are
root-local manifestation totals; missing bytes use the last known size or zero
when no size was ever observed. Indexed and guaranteed-complete bounds are
half-open UTC-microsecond coverage bounds for that root. `clock_quality`
`unknown` means no clock relation is known, `unsynchronized` means the
producer clock is known to be independent but has no finite bound, and
`bounded` requires `clock_uncertainty_us` as the maximum absolute UTC error.
The latter two columns describe measurement quality and never change semantic
IDs.

Allowance-observation identity is copy-stable. Its canonical tuple is exactly
`(limit_id, cycle_id, plan_identity, window_kind, reset_identity,
observation_ordinal, used_percent, remaining_percent, absolute_fields_json,
reset_time_us, observed_at_us, measurement_mask)`. `observation_ordinal` is the
adapter-native semantic ordinal within a cycle, not a file record ordinal.
Repeated observations remain distinct when their semantic ordinal or observed
instant differs; copied occurrences with the same tuple share one
`observation_id`.

### Multi-producer copy-stability vector

**Vector:** `database-v1.multi-producer-copy-stability.v1`

Two configured producers (`producer-a`, `producer-b`) expose distinct source
roots and stable file manifestations but contain byte-identical logical
session, turn, model-call, tool, and allowance-observation records:

| Entity table | Shared semantic ID | Producer A coordinate | Producer B coordinate | Canonical rows | Occurrence coordinates |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| `sessions` | `session:shared` | `root:a/file:a#1` | `root:b/file:b#1` | 1 | 2 |
| `turns` | `turn:shared` | `root:a/file:a#2` | `root:b/file:b#2` | 1 | 2 |
| `model_calls` | `call:shared` | `root:a/file:a#3` | `root:b/file:b#3` | 1 | 2 |
| `tool_invocations` | `tool:shared` | `root:a/file:a#4` | `root:b/file:b#4` | 1 | 2 |
| `allowance_observations` | `allowance-observation:shared` | `root:a/file:a#5` | `root:b/file:b#5` | 1 | 2 |

The schema contract test freezes the structural preconditions for this vector:
semantic entity primary keys remain producer-independent while
`source_occurrences.semantic_logical_id` remains non-unique. CK-05 repository
qualification must prove canonical typed writes coalesce the copies; CK-06
ingestion qualification must prove both physical coordinates survive as
distinct `source_occurrences`. Those executable writer qualifications, not this
DDL-only test, own the one-row/two-occurrence assertion and prove producer,
root, and file IDs cannot inflate exact accounting.

`source_manifestations` owns the mutable state of the stable file lineage
described above. `source_cursors` is the only committed resume cursor and
always points immediately after a complete JSONL record. A partial final line
never advances it. Prefix-through-cursor, suffix, source size, parser version,
and adapter version must all match before an append is classified safe.

`source_occurrences` preserves every valid physical occurrence, including
copies and archived/replacement manifestations. Canonical typed rows reference
one primary occurrence for ordering; evidence resolution returns that and every
additional occurrence with the same semantic logical ID. The canonical writer,
not the adapter, owns deduplication and collision checks.

`lifecycle_transitions` is append-only. Lifecycle-capable typed rows contain
the current deterministic fold. A small publication inserts new transitions
and updates only the affected typed fold in the same transaction. Absence of a
terminal transition never closes an entity. Terminal occurrence coordinates
remain distinct from start coordinates. Recanonicalization or unbounded
correction uses an isolated artifact.

`late_parent_edges` is the append-only observation stream for parent discovery;
`sessions.parent_session_id`, `root_session_id`, and `delegation_depth` are its
current acyclic fold. Late hierarchy repair changes no activity timestamp and
creates no usage.

## Publication, delta, and current projection ownership

`publication_head` is the single same-snapshot analytical authority.
`publications`, its three coverage tables, `publication_deltas`,
`publication_delta_entities`, and bounded `publication_delta_samples` commit
atomically with accepted facts, cursors, lifecycle folds, and the head.
Recanonicalized entities are reported separately and are not counted as new
usage. Nullable token deltas remain unavailable when the corresponding
measurement is not complete; they are never coerced to zero.

The selected Candidate A current-only projection subset is reserved as:

```text
session_usage_current
usage_total_current
model_effort_usage_current
project_family_usage_current
model_usage_current
turn_action_current
resource_operation_current
tool_family_current
```

CK-09 owns admission, exact columns, indexes, dependency registry, dirty-key
statements, reconciliation plans, and budgets for those projections. They are
intentionally absent from database-v1 DDL until a named-plan consumer passes
the CK-09 admission rule. CK-07 owns only the projection-maintainer port and
must tolerate an empty admitted registry. `evidence_page_anchor_current` is
also deferred to CK-08 and may be admitted only if a measured deep-page
consumer justifies it.

Current valuation is computed from immutable calls plus the validated
rate-card lineage whose head is selected by `active_rate_card`. CK-07D adds
only `predecessor_rate_card_id`, the minimal linkage needed to reproduce that
publication-captured frontier; it does not add a call-to-rate assignment.
There is no `valuation_matches_current` table in database-v1. CK-08 may keep
that effective-dated join query-time; CK-09 may materialize it only through the
same measured projection-admission rule. Optional context-component storage is
outside the MVP contract rather than an unspecified database choice. Point
events are represented by the indexed typed streams and
`lifecycle_transitions`; no global event-backbone table is admitted. Query
windows are request values and are not persisted. The projection, deep-page
anchor, and current-valuation materialization decisions named here are the only
deferred physical choices in this contract.

`model_call_tail`, `model_call_tail_state`, and `model_calls_visible` are CK-07
storage, not projections. The tail is append-only and capped at 32,000 rows.
The planner chooses an isolated fold before the cap, byte, WAL, fanout, or
staleness budget is crossed. Cross-table call identity and tail-state checks
are mandatory before commit.

## Operational sidecar DDL

The sidecar uses its own transaction and foreign-key domain. It may lag a
successful analytical commit and must be reconcilable from publication
`operation_id`. Error text is bounded structural metadata only; it must not
contain source bodies, prompts, responses, command bodies, patches, reasoning,
or tool-output bodies.

`operational_metadata` contains
`database_identity=codex-usage-tracker.agent-kernel.operations.v1`,
`schema_contract_id`, `schema_contract_sha256`, and `schema_version=1`.

`source_dirty_hints` is keyed exactly by
`(source_id, technical_path_key)`. The sidecar cannot declare a cross-database
foreign key, so CK-07 validates `source_id` against the selected analytical
publication before consuming a hint. A hint identifies root-relative technical
provenance, not a stable file identity; discovery resolves the current file
lineage and may create a replacement manifestation at the same path.

## Active pointer and rollback protocol

The filesystem pointer, not `artifact_pointers`, selects which owner-only
analytical artifact to open. Its fixed name is
`active-artifact-pointer-v1.json`. It is canonical JSON with exactly:

```json
{
  "active": {
    "artifact_name": "artifact-<opaque>.sqlite3",
    "artifact_manifest_sha256": "<64 lowercase hex>",
    "file_sha256": "<64 lowercase hex>",
    "publication_id": "<logical publication id>",
    "schema_contract_sha256": "<this contract digest>"
  },
  "generation": 1,
  "rollback": null,
  "schema": "codex-usage-tracker.agent-kernel.artifact-pointer.v1",
  "written_at_us": 0
}
```

`rollback`, when present, has the same five fields as `active`. The host writes
one same-directory temporary file with canonical JSON, flushes and fsyncs it,
atomically replaces the fixed pointer, then fsyncs the containing owner-only
directory. Artifact basenames may not contain a separator or `..`.

`artifact_manifest_sha256` is the digest of canonical JSON containing the
publication ID and parent, schema-contract digest, source-cursor inventory
digest, coverage rows, entity counts, publication delta, projection-registry
digest, and active rate-card digest; the digest field itself is excluded.
`file_sha256` is the finalized SQLite file hash at isolated promotion. It is
required for a new isolated candidate and for a rollback artifact, and becomes
`null` for an active artifact after its first proven-small in-place
publication. Such an active artifact is instead validated by its internal
manifest digest plus SQLite and relationship checks.

An isolated candidate is checkpointed, closed, validated, file-hashed, fsynced,
and recorded in a `prepared` recovery intent before pointer replacement.
Promotion verifies the expected generation and parent, writes a new generation
whose rollback is the prior active pair, reopens and validates the selected
artifact, then reconciles sidecar rows. A small publication commits the
analytical head first and atomically advances the pointer generation with the
same artifact name, new publication/manifest, and `file_sha256=null`; startup
uses `publications.operation_id` to repair a crash between those two steps.
Once an artifact becomes rollback it is checkpointed, closed, physically
hashed, and never mutated while referenced. Cleanup may delete only
unreferenced unpublished artifacts after ownership and age checks; active and
rollback artifacts are protected.

Startup is read-first: parse and validate the pointer; validate active
publication/schema/manifest agreement and the file digest when one is present.
If the pointer names the same artifact but its publication lags a valid
committed head by one recoverable operation, the host accepts that committed
head and repairs the pointer generation; otherwise it falls back to the
matching rollback pair. It opens analytical reads before reconciling sidecar
jobs, intents, and leases. If a small analytical commit completed before the
sidecar terminal update, `publications.operation_id` proves completion.
Sidecar corruption or lock contention must not make a valid analytical
artifact unavailable.

## CK-05 through CK-07 responsibility split

- CK-05 implements the analytical database connection modes, canonical
  identity registry, configured-producer/source-root/stable-file repositories,
  typed repositories, source-occurrence repository,
  lifecycle fold/transition repository, exact DDL inventory, and digest
  validation. It creates no projection tables and imports no experiment or
  spike module.
- CK-06 implements bounded discovery, configured producer inventory,
  deterministic producer/source/file ranking, complete-record cursors,
  per-source-root coverage and clock-quality proposals, occurrence
  preservation, diagnostics, and canonical writes through CK-05 repositories.
  It cannot promote or mutate the sidecar state machine.
- CK-07 implements operation planning, no-change behavior, the 32,000-row call
  overlay and fold threshold, short `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` publication,
  per-source-root coverage/clock-bound and delta writes, composite
  source-root/path dirty hints, isolated artifact validation, file/directory
  durability, pointer promotion, leases, recovery intents, read-first startup
  recovery, and protected cleanup.

Candidate A's experimental `question_cases`,
`source_phase_occurrences`, fixture digests, direct `os.replace()` promotion,
non-durable JSON sidecar, and oracle-backed query assembly are forbidden in the
production package.

## Canonical serialization and digest

The digest at the top of this document is computed from the two fenced DDL
payloads, not from prose or SQLite-owned autoindexes:

1. Extract bytes strictly between the opening and closing fences inside
   `analytical-ddl` and `operational-ddl`.
2. Normalize CRLF or CR to LF, remove trailing horizontal whitespace on every
   line, remove leading and trailing blank lines, and append exactly one LF.
3. Concatenate UTF-8 bytes exactly as:

   ```text
   codex-usage-tracker.agent-kernel.schema-contract.v1\n
   analytical\n
   <normalized analytical DDL>
   operational\n
   <normalized operational DDL>
   ```

4. Hash the result with SHA-256 and encode 64 lowercase hexadecimal
   characters.

The contract test executes each normalized DDL independently with SQLite,
checks ordered object inventories and foreign-key enablement, recomputes the
canonical bytes, and compares the digest. Any column, type, nullability,
default, PK, unique constraint, FK, check, table order, view body, index
expression, direction, predicate, or index order changes the digest and
requires a measured CK-04 decision amendment.
