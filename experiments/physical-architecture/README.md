# Physical architecture bake-off

This tree is the CK-04 experiment boundary. It cannot be imported by the production
package. Candidate A, C, and D may choose different tables, indexes, SQL, projection
maintenance, and publication internals, but they consume the same frozen shared contract.

The shared contract version is `ck04-candidate-adapter-v1`. Candidate processes add this
directory to `PYTHONPATH` and import `shared`; the directory name containing the experiment
has a hyphen intentionally and is not a production Python package.

## Candidate seam

Each candidate implements `shared.CandidateAdapter`:

```python
class Adapter:
    candidate_id = "A"
    contract_version = shared.CANDIDATE_ADAPTER_CONTRACT_VERSION

    def execute(self, request: shared.CandidateRequest) -> shared.CandidateResult:
        ...
```

`execute()` is the only candidate-specific callable in the bake-off runner. The immutable
request carries a verified CK-03 fixture/oracle bundle, one workload case, a disposable run
root, a repetition number, and the early-stop controller. Unsupported optional experiments
return `RunOutcome.UNSUPPORTED`; a candidate may not omit a mandatory case. A stopped run
must first trip the shared controller and remains a recorded partial failure.
Every non-unsupported result includes `MeasurementValues`; `execute_measured_candidate()`
binds those values to the host clocks, pinned environment, fixture and workload digests.

`load_fixture_bundle()` verifies canonical manifest bytes, manifest and oracle SHA-256
digests, every persisted source's exact bytes/records/digest, the five vertical slices, and
the required question cases. It rejects absolute, escaping, missing, or non-CK-03 inputs.

## Frozen workload and measurements

`build_workload_matrix(physical_cores=...)` returns stable case IDs for:

- every required history build, monotonic expansion, scale, parser-worker count, writer and
  index mode, and unpublished schema upgrade;
- all nine ordinary changes and seven isolated-artifact unsafe changes;
- every P1 named preset and required vertical-slice question in cold, warm, and repeated
  modes, plus deep pages, exact count, valuation replacement, selected timeline,
  deterministic ties, and bounded full sorting;
- all nine publication termination boundaries and the injected-fault union required by the
  bake-off and qualification plan;
- two non-model DBHub local-route cases (`generic` and `named_preset`), with five
  globally sequenced alternating samples per route, and the file-based agent-perf
  attribution workload.

The matrix digest includes the qualification host's physical-core input. Candidate result
files use `codex-usage-tracker.physical-bakeoff-measurement.v2`. The collector owns wall and
process clocks; the candidate supplies the remaining explicit resource, storage, ingestion,
projection, plan, MCP, call, token, correctness, selector, and publication measurements.
Candidate A materializes the exact 13-domain evidence-row count during publication and updates
it by authenticated ordinary-change deltas in the same writer transaction. Exact-count queries
read that validated fact instead of rescanning multi-million-row indexes; prepublication
validation recomputes the count, and ordinary-change tests compare every maintained delta with
the underlying domains.
JSON Lines records are canonical and append-only. Candidate A ordinary-tail records separately
report operation latency after preparation, WAL frames written during a clean checkpoint epoch,
and explicit committed analytical transactions; each value carries its exact provenance basis.
Host wall time remains separate from operation latency.

Speed claims require at least five unprofiled samples. `distribution_summary()` fixes median,
nearest-rank p95, maximum, and population coefficient of variation. `rank_candidates()` uses
the seven documented weights and deterministic lower-cost normalization over identical
fixture digests and scale. Profile output is attribution evidence only.

Qualification hosts may pass
`--build-repetition-cooldown-seconds <0..300>` to insert an unmeasured pause
between repeated build samples. The exact cooldown is bound into the canonical
invocation. It does not alter a case's measured wall time, early-stop limit,
fixture, or candidate behavior; use it to prevent teardown I/O or thermal load
from one large build contaminating the next repetition.

The qualification runner retains canonical invocation, measurement, and summary files but
discards candidate run roots by default. When Candidate A's matching `build.scale.<profile>`
case, query cases, and ordinary changes share an invocation, invocation schema v3 records
`prepared_scale_artifact_policy`: each query repetition opens that repetition's completed
scale artifact read-only, while each ordinary change receives an independent clone before
measured execution. The clone validates a regular retained database, no rollback journal,
an absent or empty WAL, and no Candidate A publication lease; it uses argv-only `/bin/cp -c`
and never copies sidecars or falls back to a full copy. Preparation timing is recorded as
preparation evidence, outside the ordinary-operation measurement.
Build timing remains isolated in the scale case, ordinary timing begins after cloning, query
timing begins after artifact selection, and the runner deletes the temporarily retained
scale roots after all consumers finish. Candidate A records the build-time digest alongside one
static storage metric snapshot for each retained scale artifact; prepared queries validate its resolved-path,
device/inode, size, mtime, and journal/WAL assumptions before reusing its
table/index/free-list/row facts, while refreshing the current process peak RSS. A mismatch
fails the query before evidence is emitted rather than rescanning or reporting stale storage.
This avoids rebuilding an identical multi-gigabyte fixture without changing either score input. Pass
`--retain-run-artifacts` only for a bounded diagnostic that genuinely needs the generated
candidate database; the retention choice is recorded in both invocation and summary
artifacts.

Raw qualification output belongs under
`experiments/physical-architecture/.measurements/`, which is ignored by Git. The accepted
decision commits only bounded canonical manifests containing the exact input and output
hashes, environment identity, score calculation, sensitivity results, approved query-plan
exceptions, crash observations, and research-lane metrics needed to audit the selection.

## Publication failures

`PublicationCrashDriver` is the process-control seam. The driver launches and terminates its
own candidate, while the shared harness selects `CrashCase` and compares `CrashObservation`
with the CK-03 oracle. The prior publication, rollback, sidecar terminal state, abandoned
artifact disposition, and subsequent recovery are all observed facts; exceptions or a
candidate's assertion are not substitutes.

The aggregate v2 evidence additionally requires the positive worker PID, actual and expected
exit code `86`, exit-code termination kind, requested and persisted boundary, lease/PID
agreement, post-exit liveness check, and exact hashes of the recovery-terminal and subsequent
publication records. Injected faults retain `process.status=not_applicable` in the aggregate
while still carrying their observed recovery stage, action, and record hashes.

## DBHub research

`build_dbhub_run()` creates a disposable copy of a synthetic SQLite snapshot, removes all
write bits, records its digest, writes one TOML configuration, and returns shell-free stdio
argv pinned to `@bytebase/dbhub@0.24.0` and its npm integrity. The live 0.24.0 connector opens
SQLite read-write before its tools apply `PRAGMA query_only`, so this lane cannot truthfully
claim an engine-level read-only connection. `DbhubRun.runtime_access()` grants owner-write
permission only for the MCP process, then restores mode `0444` and fails if the digest
changed. The row cap is at most 100. Only schema search, generic read SQL, and one to four
single-statement parameterized read tools are admitted. `verify_unchanged()` is mandatory
after the MCP process exits.

DBHub is dev-only comparison infrastructure, never a candidate, runtime dependency, plugin,
or user workflow.

CK-04 deliberately executes the local generic route
(`search_objects` plus `execute_sql`) and named-preset route (`top_sessions`); it does not
ask a model to select a route. Each sample records result rows/hash, correctness, wall and
process CPU time, response bytes, and the exact MCP-call count. `scanned_rows` and
`sql_statements` remain observed/unavailable provenance objects because returned rows and
route shape are not substitutes for those measurements.

The current runner invokes no model. Exact installed-model identity, host and runtime
versions, reasoning effort, synthetic-input artifact identity/hash, token source, and
authorization for billed calls are a deferred CK-11 operability gate.

## Agent Perf

Each candidate provides a JSON file conforming to
`shared/agent-perf-workload-v1.schema.json`. The file names exactly one synthetic standard
`build.scale.standard` command with `{python}`, `{fixture_root}`, and `{output_root}`
placeholders and pins the CK-03 fixture revision, manifest/oracle digests, and workload
matrix digest. Shells, absolute/private paths, secret-like environment variables, alternate
profiled commands, and fewer than five unprofiled runs are rejected. Agent Perf wraps this
same command; it does not define a second workload.

Fixture generation time is excluded from candidate timing. Do not run production or growth
workloads in routine checks; those are explicit qualification-host operations.
